//! German compound word checker using lazy decomposition.
//!
//! This module provides runtime compound word checking for German, which avoids
//! the O(n²) memory explosion of pre-generating all possible compound combinations.
//! Instead, it stores only the base words with their compound flags and checks
//! at lookup time whether a word can be decomposed into valid compound parts.
//!
//! Any dictionary word of at least [`MIN_COMPOUND_PART_LEN`] characters — or a
//! shorter one carrying compound-formation flags — may act as a compound
//! element, and every standard German interfix (`""`, `s`, `n`, `en`, `er`,
//! `es`) is attempted at each boundary. Membership is resolved against the
//! base dictionary when one is injected via [`CompoundChecker::set_base_dictionary`],
//! otherwise against a casing-tolerant set built from the word list.
//!
//! The one restriction on top of that is
//! [`can_head_a_lowercase_compound`], which is what keeps `vieleicht` from
//! decomposing.
//!
//! `GermanSpellCheck` has a second, weaker decomposition of its own. It shares
//! these constants so the two cannot disagree about what an element is, but it
//! is only reached when this one has already declined the word.
//!
//! Subproblems are memoized by `(segment, depth)`, turning the previously
//! exponential re-decomposition of long or misspelled words into a
//! polynomial-time scan.
